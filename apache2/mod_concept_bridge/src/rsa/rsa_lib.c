/*	rsa_lib/rsa_lib.c
 *      This RSA library is using BN module from OpenSSL Project (www.openssl.org)
 *      NOTE:
 *      1. This RSA library is stricted to only 2048 bits modulo value (=N).
 *      2. Only use two primes, P and Q (each 1024 bits), DOES NOT use multi prime.
 *      3. This RSA encryption library is DESIGNED for private individual or group use only.
 *      4. It follows the rules in PKCS#1 v2.1 (as per 5th January 2001).
 *      5. Use a slightly different OAEP algorithm, yet it possesses a strong cryptography.
 *      6. The strong/weak point is in BN_RAND_HL.C (random number generator based on time)
 *      7. No hash function.
 *      8. The certificate (public key) is NOT compatible for X509.
 *      Last compiled Wednesday, 26th June 2001 */
