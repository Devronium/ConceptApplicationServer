   basically the definition of a twip is that there

   figure in pixels, so we have to take some screen
   resolution as a standard to work from.

   if we were to take hozitontal twips and a 1280 pixel
   wide screen then there are
   1440 twips per 75 pixels

   if we were to take vertical twips and a 1024 pixel
   high screen then there are
   1440 twips per 75 pixels
