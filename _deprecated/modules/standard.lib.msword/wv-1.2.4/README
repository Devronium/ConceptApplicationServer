Read INSTALL for install information, basically pretty standard
requirements for a modern *NIX program plus libwmf to convert
wmf files to something useful.

There are now a small herd of programs based upon libwv. AbiWord
(http://www.abisource.com/) is the most interesting and complete
one that we're aware of.

1) wvWare: this is what you are looking for, it converts
Word 2,6,7,8,9 files to html and latex. The Word 2 conversion
is still incomplete (no formatting), but it will do a passable
job extracting the text, which is what you probably want anyway.

2) The small army of helper scripts:
	wvHtml
	wvLatex
	wvCleanLatex
	wvPS
	wvDVI
	wvPDF
	wvMime
	wvText
	...
   Do: `man wvXXX` where "XXX" is Html, Latex, etc.. for more information

3) wvSummary, displays the summary information stream of *all*
ole2 files, i.e Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, Access etc etc etc,
I've sent wvSummary as a patch to the file program, so that utility
should in the future have this ability to know what windows application
created the ole2 document. `man wvSummary`

4) wvVersion, outputs the version of the word format which the document
is stored as. `man wvVersion`

Also...

5) There are helper applications in the helper-scripts dir
that allow both lynx and netscape to view word 8 docs easily

6) The webpage is at http://wvware.sourceforge.net/

Finally...

7) libwv can be used as a library by third party programs, abiword
uses it as its word importer, and kword may use it in the future.
wvWare is a sample application for the use of wv, as is abiword
itself. The library (will be some day) documented in the 
Documentation dir

8) The config file format is (beginning to be) documented in the
Documentation dir, so it may be possible to achieve the conversion
that you desire without writing your own program. It also allows
you to customize the html and latex output to your own tastes.

Some possible "fun" projects:

(Projects for someone to try out with libwv include, could be
commercial applications)

a) wvMacroRemove, deletes macros out of word files, for the security
concious

b) wvFastToFull, converts fastsaved docs to full saved, shrinking their
size usually by quite a lot, and also making them safe for security 
consious firms

c) wvCrackProtection, take the wvDecrypt97 code and make a cracker
that uses the rc4 algorithm and other known bit of information to
crack word documents, ala http://www.crak.com
